## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go** (1.18 or later)
- **Discord Bot Token**: You can create a bot in the Discord Developer Portal.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x0060/ActiBot.git
cd ActiBot
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. **Configure your bot**:
   Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:

```json
{
   "DiscordToken": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
   "APIPort": ":8080"
}
```

   - Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual Discord bot token.
   - You can change the `APIPort` if you want the bot to run on a different port.
  

## Running the Bot

Once you have everything set up, you can run the bot with the following command:

```bash
go run cmd/bot/main.go
```

This will start the bot and it will begin listening for user activities on Spotify.


## Usage

Once the bot is running, it will automatically update your Discord status based on your current Spotify activity. Additionally, you can access user activity data via the provided API endpoints. Make sure to invite the bot to your Discord server and grant it the necessary permissions to manage your presence.

### Inviting the Bot to Your Server

To invite the bot to your Discord server, you need to use the following URL format:

https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=YOUR_PERMISSIONS&scope=bot


- Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your Discord bot's client ID.
- Set the desired permissions in `YOUR_PERMISSIONS` (e.g., `8192` for presence updates).


## Configuration

Alternatively, you can use a `config.yaml` file instead of `config.json`. Here‚Äôs how it should look:

```yaml
DiscordToken: "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
APIPort: ":8080"
```
